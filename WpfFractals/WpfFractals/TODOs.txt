TODOs:
Continue implementing user interface controls for symmetric tree  and implement for Koch Snowflake
Implement user input validation on controls (1.5 children doesn't make sense)
properly grok the Koch Snowflake algorithm in order to improve the comments


Fixes:

Refactoring:

Features:

	Symmetric Tree fractal features:
Consider accomodating multiple start points

	Asymmetric Tree fractal:
Implement it. double[] angles & child scale

	Line bending fractal features
Generalize the line bending fractal to accomodate arbitrary bending patterns


Future dev:
Re-implement as Lindenmayer systems (with associated L-system interpretation engine)

Implement non-line fractals (Mandelbrot)
