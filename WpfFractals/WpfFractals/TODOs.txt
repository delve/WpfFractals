TODOs:
properly grok the Koch Snowflake algorithm in order to improve the comments


Fixes:

Refactoring:

Features:
These generalizing features will likely require stripping out the DrawFractal implementation entirely and defining the rendering algorithm as a function parameter or property. 
	Might also require adding a collection of arbitrary objects to hold implementation specific variables.

Generalize the line extension fractal to accomodate parameterized branch spread (total angle of spread) and number of branches defaulted to the current 2 branches and 2PI/5 total spread angle
   as well as allowing arbitrary branching point in the line (single point only)

Generalize the line bending fractal to accomodate arbitrary bending patterns

Future dev:
The fractal window could be used as a base class to create 'complex' windows defining controls that allow interaction with the fractal
	(a collection of WPF controls defined by the contained fractal object)
