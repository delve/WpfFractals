TODOs:
properly grok the Koch Snowflake algorithm in order to improve the comments


Fixes:

Refactoring:

Features:
These generalizing features will likely require stripping out the DrawFractal implementation entirely and defining the rendering algorithm as a function parameter or property. 
	Might also require adding a collection of arbitrary objects to hold implementation specific variables.

	Line extension fractal features:
Accomodate parameterized branch spread (total angle of spread) defaulted to the current 2PI/5 total spread angle
Accomodate parameterized number of branches defaulted to the current 2 branches
Allow angle of rotation for ChildOffest (starting the child line on some point not along the parent but relative to the parents' ending point)
Consider accomodating multiple start points

	Line bending fractal features
Generalize the line bending fractal to accomodate arbitrary bending patterns

Future dev:
Implement non-line fractals (Mandelbrot)

The fractal window could be used as a base class to create 'complex' windows defining controls that allow interaction with the fractal
	(a collection of WPF controls defined by the contained fractal object)

Re-implement as Lindenmayer systems (with associated L-system interpretation engine)
