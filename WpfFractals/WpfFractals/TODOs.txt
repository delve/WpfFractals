TODOs:
from MainWindow.xaml.cs:
            // TODO: using the BrushCanvasBG property as the data bind source for the convas background doesn't seem to work. 
            //       Don't know why offhand. Assigning the brush property to the canvas background in the constructor didn't work 
            //       either. Probably that assignment occurs before the object initialization syntax puts an object in the property. 
            //       Assigning it directly like this works but feels ugly like puppet strings.

Refactoring:
Extract a Fractal object from the implementations in LineFractalWindow. Abstract Fractal, concrete LineFractal, Mandlebrot, &etc
The LineFractalWindow class can be made general purpose be pulling all the fractal-specific processing out, giving it a fractal type member, and leaving it as just a 
	display frame with a start button.


Furture dev:
The fractal window could be used as a base class to create 'complex' windows defining controls that allow interaction with the fractal
	(a collection of WPF controls defined by the contained fractal object)

Generalize the Binary Tree fractal to a Tree with parameterized branch spread (total angle of spread) and number of branches defaulted to the current 2 branches and 2PI/5 total spread angle
