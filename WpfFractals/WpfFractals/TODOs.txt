TODOs:
Implement user controls for Koch Snowflake
Implement user input validation on controls (1.5 children doesn't make sense, speed and render depth can't both be 0)
Try IValueConverter to make the UI values prettier (maybe do angle in degrees, convert length ratio and offset lengthto whole number %s)

Fixes:

Refactoring:

Features:

	Symmetric Tree fractal features:
Consider accomodating multiple start points

	Asymmetric Tree fractal:
Implement it. double[] angles & child scale

	Line bending fractal features
Generalize the line bending fractal to accomodate arbitrary bending patterns

Future dev:
Re-implement as Lindenmayer systems (with associated L-system interpretation engine)

Implement non-line fractals (Mandelbrot)
